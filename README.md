❄ Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. 
    
❄ The term malnutrition addresses 3 broad groups of conditions:
    ❄ "Undernutrition" : It includes wasting (low weight-for-height), stunting (low height-for-age) and underweight (low weight-for-age);
    ❄ "Micronutrient-related malnutrition" : It includes micronutrient deficiencies (a lack of important vitamins and minerals) or micronutrient excess; and
    ❄ Overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers).
    
❄ 1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese, while 462 million are underweight.
    
❄ Globally in 2020, 
    ❄ 149 MM children under 5 were estimated to be stunted (too short for age),
    ❄ 45 MM were estimated to be wasted (too thin for height), and 
    ❄ 38.9 MM were overweight or obese

❄ Around 45% of deaths among children under 5 years of age due to undernutrition. 
    ❄ These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries.
